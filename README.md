# 👋 Hi, I’m Rasheed

I’m a Computer Science student with a Data Science concentration, an electrician by trade, and a data-driven problem solver with a strong interest in analytics, transportation systems, and community-focused research.

My background blends hands-on technical work (railroad electrical systems, logistics, operations) with programming, data analysis, and applied research. I like understanding how systems actually work, then using data to make them better.

---

## 🎯 What I’m Working Toward

My long-term goal is to work in **data analytics, data science, or research-oriented roles** where data supports:
- Smarter transportation and infrastructure decisions  
- Operational efficiency and risk reduction  
- Community impact and equity-focused analysis  

I’m especially interested in roles that sit at the intersection of **data, policy, and real-world systems**.

## 🧠 Current Focus

- **B.S. in Computer Science (Data Science concentration)**  
  Northeastern Illinois University  
  Expected Graduation: **May 2026**

- Building projects in:
  - Python-based data analysis and modeling
  - SQL and database design
  - Applied statistics and regression
  - Spatial and urban data analysis
  - Sports and probability modeling (for fun and learning)

- Learning how to communicate insights clearly, not just build models.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills

**Programming & Data**
- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- SQL (queries, joins, schema design)
- Data cleaning, EDA, regression, classification
- Working with structured and unstructured data

**Analytics & Tools**
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
- Excel / Google Sheets (advanced formulas, analysis)
- Intro to GIS & spatial statistics

**Domain Experience**
- Transportation systems
- Logistics and operations
- Electrical and mechanical systems
- Regulatory and safety-driven environments

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub is a mix of:
- Class projects and assignments
- Personal data experiments and models
- Analysis notebooks
- Learning projects where I try things, break things, and improve them

Some projects are polished. Some are raw. All of them reflect how I think and learn.

## 📈 How I Think About Data

I believe:
- Context matters as much as numbers  
- Models should be explainable, not just accurate  
- Data is most powerful when it supports real decisions  
- Good analysis asks *why*, not just *what*
